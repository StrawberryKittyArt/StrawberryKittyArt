 <h2>Biography</h2>
 <p>In video games, Briner voiced Ichi, the love interest of the main character, in Cibele, an indie video game about developing an online relationship. Cibele won a Nuovo Award at 2016 Independent Games Festival,[9][10] and made Briner's name known in mainstream news.[10][11]</p>  
 <p>In My Hero Academia, Briner voiced the lead character Izuku Midoriya, a middle school student who was not born with superhero powers but lives in a superhero-based world, and is recruited to enroll in a school for superheroes. Alex Osborn of IGN described his performance as excellent and standout,[12] while Tom Speelman of Polygon noted that he and his Japanese counterpart "nail the optimistic nerdiness and heroic attitude" with Briner "channeling a bit of Morty Smith for good measure".[13] The series has run for five seasons, with Briner and fellow voice actor Christopher Sabat doing panels and interviews at anime conventions including Anime Expo and San Diego Comic-Con regarding their work on the show.[14][15]</p>    
 <P>Briner has continued to voice lead and main characters in other anime shows. He voiced Alfonso San Valiante the crown prince in the first Garo: The Animation series, which Robert Prentice of Three If By Space described the English cast "a great lineup", in particular highlighting Briner.[16] In 2016, voiced Lance in the anime adaptation of Puzzle & Dragons X,[17] and Nasu no Yoichi in the alternate history anime Drifters.[18] In the prison comedy Nanbaka, his vocal performance was described as "more awestruck and childlike" than that of the original Japanese counterpart.[19] Anne Laurenroth of Anime News Network found Briner's portrayal of Kensuke Hanasaki in Trickster helped prevent his pre-backstory character from getting overly annoying.[20] Briner has also been involved in the production side as the head writer on the ADR script for Rio: Rainbow Gate.[21]

    In 2017, he voiced lead characters Haruki Mishima in Convenience Store Boy Friends, Tazuna Takatsuki in Hand Shakers, and Ernesti "Eru" Echavalier in Knight's & Magic.[22][23] In the same year, he landed the lead role of Justice "Seigi" Akatsuka in Taboo Tattoo.[24][25]</P>
